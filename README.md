# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to make a simple webpage showing a simple recipe I have picked in the internet. It will contains an Image of the recipe, a brief description of it, its list of ingredients and the process of making such recipe.

In here, I am expected to apply the previous lesson I have learned such as Headings, Paragraphs, Listing, Images, and Links.
