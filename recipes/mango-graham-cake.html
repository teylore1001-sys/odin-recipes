    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With delicious layers of sweetened cream, graham crackers, and Manila mangoes, Mango Royale is the perfect Summer treat! This Filipino icebox cake is creamy and refreshing with loads of fresh fruit flavor. A favorite for all occasions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Ripe Mangoes</li>
        <li>1 Pint / 475 mls of Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>14oz / 400g of Sweetened Condensed Milk ( I used about 3/4 of this Tin)</li>
        <li>1 Packet of Graham Crackers or any Oatmeal Biscuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel, slice and dice the mango into small cubes.
Pour the cream into a bowl and whip until you have stiff peaks. Add the condensed milk and stir through until mixed.
Place a layer of the the Graham Crackers into your dish. Spoon on some of the cream and spread over the crackers. Cover the cream with a layer of the dices mangoes.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 4 to 6 once. Top with the last layer of crackers. Cover the crackers with the cream and make as smooth as you can.
Crush up some of the crackers till you have fine cracker crumbs and sprinkle on top of the cream.
Place in the fridge to chill right through and allow the crackers to soften up and become fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the Graham Cake has chilled I like to leave it overnight, it is ready to be served.</li>
    </ol>
